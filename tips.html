                         Hostile mobs spawn in at night and they do NOT want to be friends. 
                         They will try and attack you which normally ends with the game over screen for you.
                         to avoid hostile mobs be sure to sleep at night using a bed. If you are in the unfortunate
                          scenario where you have not yet ontained a bed or it is lost/ destroyed, stay in a confined
                         space like your house where the mobs can't reach you.

                        <dd>
                          If you place lots of torches around your house hostile mobs can't spawn near you.

                        <dd>
                            go mining underground to avoid surprise attacks just be sure to place torches as you go and
                            be careful there are no hostile mobs in the shadow infront of you.

                     <dt>craft a shield</dt>
                        <dd>
                            shields are super handy for defence against hostile mobs. just by croutching you have a
                            barrier between you and the mob but be careful, they can break easily if used. To craft 
                            a sheild you need one iron ingot and six wooden planks, once crafted place in your off-hand
                            and you're good to go!
