     <h1>Frequently asked questions about Minecraft</h1> 
     <dl>
        <dt class="dt-faq">what is minecraft</dt>
        <dd class="dd-faq">Minecraft is a sandbox game where you can create, destory, build, explore and much more. 
            It is one of the most popular video games in the world.</dd>
        <dt class="dt-faq">what are the different modes in minecraft</dt>
        <dd class="dd-faq"> There are two main ways to play which is survival and creative.
         In survival you can take damage and you have to obtain all items manually through gameplay.
         In creative you can't take damage, you can obtain all items through the inventory menue and you can even fly.
        there are also three other modes including hardcore (a harder version of survival where if you die you can't respawn), 
        spectator (like creative exept you can't interact with the world and you can phase through blocks) and 
        adventure (like survival exept you can't break blocks unless using correct tool)</dd>
        <dt class="dt-faq"> should I get minecraft bedrock or java edition</dt>
        <dd class="dd-faq"> while bedrock is cheaper the mods for java are free and many people believe that it is better than bedrock. 
            Bedrock is probably the better option if you just want to play the game a little bit though. If you are unsure do 
            some reaserch to find which one best suits your needs </dd>
